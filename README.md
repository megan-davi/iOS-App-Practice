# iOS-App-Practice
iOS apps created in conjunction with The App Brewery's [Udemy iOS 12 Course](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/content)

See folders for screenshots of applications.

### 01 :: I Am Rich
This is a simple app which displays an image and a label. Based off of the thousand-dollar-app which sold eight times on the App Store. Created in order to gain a good understanding of Xcode and how image views interface with the IDE. 

### 02 :: Dicee
This app allows the user to roll two dice when a button is pressed. The dice will also roll when a user shakes their phone. Created as an introduction to Swift code as well as to understand how code interfaces with the app views. This also utiilizes a method to run the same set of code in multiple places throughout the document.

### 02.5 :: Swift Practice file
Contains three functions for some practice in Swift before creating more apps. The first function calculates a BMI using an if-else statement, the second writes a song using a loop, and the third loops through the fibonacci sequence recursively. 

### 03 :: Xylophone
When a xylophone button is pressed, one of seven different notes is played. This was used as an introduction to searching for a built-in method that Swift provides, which was AVAudioPlayer in this case. This is my first app to use a do-catch block as well as troubleshoot error messages with [osstatus](https://osstatus.com), a third-party tool. 

### 04 :: Quizzler
This app allows a user to click through a quiz app answering true or false questions. The most important take-away from building this app is understanding how the model-view-controller design can be implemented in iOS apps. Learning points in this app include UI alerts (pop-up messages), accessing arrays and troubleshooting related bugs, and accessing a [third-party library](https://github.com/relatedcode/ProgressHUD) to show a head-up display for the user.

### 05 :: Destini
A "Choose Your Own Adventure Game" which allows a user to click through different scenarios of a story. This was mostly created to solidify knowledge gained thus far. Newest code feature is hiding buttons at the end of each story line.
