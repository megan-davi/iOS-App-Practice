iOS apps created in conjunction with The App Brewery's [Udemy iOS 12 Course](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/content)

See folders for screenshots of applications.

### 01 :: I Am Rich
This is a simple app which displays an image and a label. Based off of the thousand-dollar-app which sold eight times on the App Store. Created in order to gain a good understanding of Xcode and how image views interface with the IDE. 

### 02 :: Dicee
This app allows the user to roll two dice when a button is pressed. The dice will also roll when a user shakes their phone. Created as an introduction to Swift code as well as to understand how code interfaces with the app views. This also utiilizes a method to run the same set of code in multiple places throughout the document.
